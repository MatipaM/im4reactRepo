        p1:`The theme of my internet art is Cozy, cottage core. I aim to make it place where users can come to relax and release any stress or frustration, they have through interacting with the art on the website. For this reason, I added an artwork to the homepage of the website. I did this not only because I wanted to give the user an accurate representation of what to expect when interacting with my website but also because the artwork shown is of a bunny character in their house. Via the use of WASD, the player can move around and using the arrow keys they can rotate the camera to adjust their viewpoint of the house. This ability to move through a cozy home seemed like an accurate metaphor for moving through my site. When the site loads, the user, like the bunny is placed in a room and left to explore. For the background, I used light purple and blue hues, as a non-highly saturated purple tends to be associated with creativity (verywellmind, 2023).`,    
        p2:`I kept my navigation bar static, in order to create a reference point for users navigating through my site. I also highlighted the site the user is currently on, to make it a reference point and therefore prevent the user from attempting to access the same page thinking it may contain different content. Visually, I wanted the navigation block to look like clouds. Therefore I kept the background of the website white, and then used white backgrounds for the individual links, whilst making the background of the nav element a sky-like lightblue.`,
        p3:`Throughout the website, I removed hard edges and replaced them with rounded edges. I did this because cottage core is associated with being cute and relaxing and hard edges seemed out of place for a cottage core visual aesthetic. `,
        p4:`For future submissions, in terms of my Internet Art, I would like to work on adding more personal touched to my spline artwork, e.g. more animations and colour customisations. The game on my Internet Art page has a blonde Caucasian girl as the main player character which is unrelatable for anyone who is not. I , therefore would like to create personalisation options for that character as well as a saving mechanic so that that data is no lost when the user revisits the website. I also think it would be cool to add a screenshot feature so the player can take photos with the character (as in Sims).`,
        p5:`In terms of improving my website  as I whole, I would like to include more animations as can be seen on the Apple.com website. Their use of animations makes the webpage more dynamic and therefore keeps the user engaged for longer. Another feature I have seen on other aspects is slightly changing background color of each section on the same webpage. This would work well on my Design page, where, I have multiple sections. I would then add links so the user could skip straight to that part they wanted to read. Dividing sections would also make it easier for the user to skim through them.`,
        p6:`In terms of technical improvements, for this submission I ended up creating a .js page for each blog post. However, I could have avoided doing this if I could have instead passed a prop via button and then loaded the same page but with the details specific to that blog post. Even though I am not sure if it is possible to do that exactly, I do think there is a way to create blog posts in a more optimal manner. In terms of improving my blog post visually, I would like to add more information to blog cards which makes them easier to identify visually, such as subheadings, an image (similar to how I created the blog cards for the Website Inspiration sections on my Design page).`,
        p7:`I also would like to prioritise usability testing and behavioural research. This would involve user interviews, anonymous surveys (as these would allow users to be honest and not just tell me what I think I would like to hear about my website). I also would like to incorporate contextual inquiry as this would allow me to identify aspects of the website which may come off as confusing or difficult for users to navigate around (Arvola, 2018). `,
        p8:`Unfortunately, I am still having an issue with my Github routing which is bringing up a 404 when I reload pages on live server. I have tried changing links and redeploying, but the issue is still persisting. I hope to have this resolved prior to the exam submission. The loading time of my internet art is very long, I would like to add a loading button so that users ar reassured that something will pop up and they are not waiting for nothing. Another bug I encountered, was not being able to get the footer to the bottom of the page, regardless of using CSS to set bottom to 0; and body with to 100vh. `,

        p1:`My wireframes are in black and white, because I wanted to minimize my use of colour, so that when I did use colour it would make those elements pop off the page. The theme of my website is cottage core, I chose this theme because I wanted to encourage the player to feel relaxed and like they have visited a place in which they can be creative with no repercussions or consequences.`,
        p2:`I increased the size of my colour pallete from my last submission, yet I still kept it minimalist. For this submission I used light-blue rgb(173, 216, 730), purple (75, 53, 118) and white. I used a white and blue for my navigation to make the individual links look like clouds. I wanted my website to convey both a cottage-core and relaxing feeling when the user interacted with it. Therefore I emphasized soft edges (border radius: 5%) and lighter colours. Lighter background had black text over it so used could easily read the text. I wanted my navigation bar to look like clouds not only because it fit in with the theme but because it also went well with the internet art I had on the homepage and design page. As both of these artworks have an interactable outside daylight area. Therefore clouds at the top of the sky matched well with the idea of the clouds in the sky of the artworks. The links in my navigation turn purple on hover (I chose purple so that the lightbulb and purple could interact as they do with the blog cards). In general Links are purple. I also made it so that when the user is on a specific page, that page turns purple, so that the user is aware on what page they are on.`,
        p3:`I used the footer to notify users when the page ended and to include my contact information in a way which was non-disruptive manner to the website’s content.  I used the navigation bar as my header so users can see when they have reached the top of the page.`,
        p4:`I only used one h1 element on each page to communicate to the user that that is where they should begin reading and that that element was the most important on the page. I also used Impact as it is a heavy weight font for all h1, h2 and h3 elements because combined with a white background commands a lot of attention. I made h1, and h2 elements uppercase, as they are mostly used for headings and therefore need to be used as markers to guide the reader’s attention. To differentiate between the headings, especially h1 and h2, I changed the font weight so that h1 stood out more. h3 was mostly used for subheading so therefore did not need to be as large. For the main text, I used Geneva as it is a Serif font therefore easier and more comfortable to read, especially when attempting to skim large columes of text.`,
        p5:`The homepage of my website contains the website title, followed by an internet artwork. I included an artwork on the first page so that the user would know what to expect as they traversed through my website. The artwork I chose, has a bunny on their house. The user can use WASD to move through the home and arrow keys to rotate the camera. I thought this artwork was fitting as the user is kind of like the bunny, traversing through their house, or in the case of the user, my website. I also included short paragraphs without a short description of what the website is about and the feelings I hope to evoke in the user as they move through the site.`,
        p6:`On the design page, I placed the rough sketches first and then the wireframes, because I wanted the user to see how the website evolved from beginning to the end product in front of them. I then placed my website inspirations detailing what aspects I liked about each website the most. The user can then also see which aspects I incorporated in my own website. And then finally I placed my design essays, with a detailed layout of my thought process when building the sight.`,
        p7:`I used a timeline in my design section because I thought it made it easier for the user to see all the pages in the order, they appear on the website. As opposed to how I presented the wireframes in my last submission, in which the user had to cycle through them (each presented on different pages) using a button. This way it is on a single web page and the user only has to scroll through them.`,
        p8:`On the theory page, I placed all the essays into blog cards. I this so that the user could easily scan all the content to find the page, they were most interested in reading. In my final, iteration I would like to add more information such as subheading’s detailing the websites content (not just the heading/ what week the essay was from, as I have now) as well as an image, to provide a visual summary. `,
        p9:`I changed the blog post design structure as I was worried that placing blog cards too close to one another may cause the page to look cluttered. However, in the next submission, I would like to implement this structure and instead use animations so that the blog post in the centre increases in size on hover, and the other blog posts are minimized. This would work as a feedback loop to notify the user which blog post they would be selecting. On Blog cards, I made sure to align the main text with the button. The blog Cards all have 3x3 alignment regardless of the actual number of blog posts, in order to maintain consistency. In general, I made use of percentages for sizing for responsive design, however, for the blog posts, on smaller screens they’ll be two cards in a row and then only a single column for mobile devices. In the future I would like to add next, previous and top buttons so that the user can cycle through the pages as opposed to return the theory page and breaking the flow of their reading process.`,
        p10:`The final page is the Internet Art page, where I placed an artwork of a town where the user can ride around and look around at different angles. All the games on the page use the same user controls WASD, and arrow keys. In my next iteration, I would like to add a small container with the user controls for users who are not familiar with gaming conventions. I made sure all of the games used the same user controls to increase familiarity between the user and the system.`,

    //     p1:`My initial goal for my internet artwork was to create an online notepad, where users could draw via any type of input device. I wanted to create a space where the user could create their own digital art for free without the need of an expensive device. However, I do recognize that accessing the website via a drawing tablet and stylus would make interacting with a virtual notepad much easier than using a mouse and keyboard. Hence creating a different experience for various users, in which those without access to expensive equipment may not find the artwork has easy to engage with.`, 
    //     p2:`My internet art returns the agency back to the user by allowing them to express how they feel instead of looking at a piece which may instruct or alter their emptions in any way. In the future, I plan to implement a system which allows users to leave their digital footprint for the next user, by saving their work and showing them to the next user who accesses the website. The internet artwork would both influence the user’s current emotions by presenting them with a partially filled canvas, but it would also empower the user by allowing them to respond.`,
    //     p3:`For future improvements, I would like to save all previous users drawings in the database, so that they can continue working on a previous draft. Another idea I had was to only save one of the previous user’s drawings in order to prevent the canvas from being overfilled and preventing future users from wanting to add on. However, I feel that would mean I would have to have some sort of selection algorithm which would choose which user’s work to save in the database, in the event that two users had been drawing at the same time. Which can be invalidating for the user’s work who is not saved. As work would be saved on refresh, therefore users can see what has been saved. Instead, the user has a thick pain brush which they can use to create their own background for their work. That way part of the creation is allowing them to decide which work should be erased in order to make room for their own. Initially when planning this artwork, I wanted to include login/sign in pages so that the user’s art could be fetched from the database when they sign in. There is an offset between the cursor and the lines drawn which can be disorienting for users. I tried to tweak the settings to bring the stroke and cursor as close together as possible, but I struggled to fix the issue.    `,

            p1:`In this essay, I will explore how I made my internet artwork as well as why I decided to place different scenes on their specific pages. I will also look at various ways of implementing the artwork which I did and did not do and provide explanations for my choices. Finally, I will examine improvements which I did not get to implement.`,
            p2:`The theme of my website is cozy and cottage core, and I wanted my internet art to correspond with that theme. I, therefore, chose colorful scenes with non-realistic interpretations of the world. As cozy aesthetics as seen in ‘Stardew Valley’ (ConcernedApe, 2016) and ‘Animal Crossing’ (Eguchi, Miyamoto, Takashi, Nogami, 2001 have more of a cartoonish aesthetic, yet their mechanics resemble that of every day life, i.e. work, clean and organized. This balance between realistic and non-realistic allows users to perform daily actions in a more forgiving and therefore relaxing space. In order, to not overpower any of the artworks or chunks of text on the page, I used less saturated blue/purple colours in the background of the navigation bars, footer and in the page backgrounds. The lower saturations increased the contrast of the important information, i.e., where I wanted the users to look and the background which could be ignored/forgotten. I used a mixture of blue and purple to mimic the skyline, as the artworks resemble that of an outside environment. Therefore, the navigation bar is designed to look like clouds in the sky.`,
            p3: `I included an artwork on my homepage, to give the viewer an idea of what my website would be about. I chose to include a spline scene of a bunny moving through their house because that scene felt like a metaphor for my website. The user is dropped in a location, that is the homepage, and like the house they are free to roam around, opening different doors (in this case links) and searching around the space each door has taken them to. `,
            p4: `The loading times of the artworks are not efficient, and I was unsure how to optimize my artwork without losing the detail (i.e., number of objects) that make the artwork enjoyable to explore. As both artworks that I include contain a large variety of objects, some of which come with their own animations.`,
            p5: `On the internet art page, I included a select character page. The default spline template I used, had a blond, white girl running through the town. However, I wanted my website to feel inclusive and relatable for as wide an audience as possible, so I included a darker skinned woman as well. The character shown in the scene displayed differs depending on which character the user has selected. I could have improved this further by giving the player a wider selection when customizing the biker, such as gender, clothing and hairstyle choice.`,
            p6: `My initial plan was to add a spline scene on each page, which I thought related to the theme of home in connection to the page the user was on. That is why I placed, a scene of a house on the home page. I placed a town on the art page, as this was the section where the artwork deserved to shine the most, and exploring a town related to the idea of home, but still allowed the player to explore and roam around on a larger landscape. I was also going to place a library on the theory page as well as a kitchen on the design page (as that is where the planning and prepping is done as in a kitchen). However, I could not figure out how to optimize the spline scene more than they are already, and I did not want every page to be affected by the slow loading times in the same way the home and artwork pages are.`,
            p7: `Another idea I had for the internet art page was to turn the scene into a game, where if the player found all the hidden objects, in a given time period, they would win the game. I chose against this, because games can sometimes be stressful, and time pressure games can increase stress levels, especially if the player feels emotionally attached to the output of the game. I felt that the cozy, cottage core aesthetic theme of my website, required a stress-free environment, where the player can simply explore the spaces provided with no pressure or expectations placed on them. When there is an objective placed in the scene, the player is less likely to roam around freely at their own pace when they would like to.`,
            p8: `In conclusion, in this essay, I looked at how I could have improved my internet art by including wider variety of options for character personalization. I spoke about how the implementation details of the various spline scenes and how my internet art not only ties into my theme but also enhances the theme of a cozy, cottage core home. `,
